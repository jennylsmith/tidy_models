# What is the Tidyverse?

--

- From the documentation: 
  - The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of <br> R packages designed for data science. 

--

- The tidyverse syntax relys on the use of a `%>%` pipe, <br> which allows for:
  - modularity 
  - readablility 


````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
library(dplyr)
mean_mass_by_homeworld <- starwars %>% 
  mutate(bmi = mass / ((height / 100)  ^ 2)) %>%
  select(name:mass, bmi, homeworld) %>% 
  group_by(homeworld) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(mass))
```
````
---


# In comparison 

````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
#base R
starwars$bmi <- bmi = mass / ((height / 100)  ^ 2)
columns_sel <- c(1:3, grep("bmi|homeworld", colnames(starwars)))
starwars <- starwars[,columns_sel]
mean_mass_by_homeworld <- tapply(starwars$mass, 
                                  starwars$homeworld, 
                                  FUN=mean)
reordered <- order(mean_mass_by_homeworld, decreasing=TRUE)
mean_mass_by_homeworld <- mean_mass_by_homeworld[reordered]
```

# Tidy Models 

- What are tidy models? 

--
  - The `tidymodels` framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.
--

- As with tidyverse
    - it includes numerous packages
    - you can pick and choose to install to complete your specific analysis
    - except of course for core packages
--

.pull-left[
- Why Tidy models?
  - Consistent interface for modeling functions
  - resampling, assessing performance, and hyperparameter tuning.
  - Performance metrics (in the yardstick package)
  - Model tuning (with the tune package)
]

# Survival Analysis 

- `censored` package along with `parsnip` package

  - `parsnip` is one of the core R packages in the Tidy Models framework

- First, survival and time-to-event analysis uses censored data.

--
  - **right censored**:  Patient enrolled on study and diagnosed on 12/20/2020 and is still alive at 12/06/2021

--

  - **left censored**: Patient was on trial on 12/20/2020, but don't know when they were diagnosed, and  was relapsed (event) by 12/06/2021

--

  - **interval censoring**: Patient was on trial on 12/20/2020, but don't know when they were diagnosed,and was not relapsed by 12/06/2021

# Cox Proportional Hazards Regression 

--
- A regression model commonly used in biomedical research

--

- The association between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables.

--

- It provides a means to estimate the risk (hazard) of the predictor variables between 2 or more groups.

--

  - For example, Patient Group A has **mutation A** and Patient group B has **no mutation**
  
  - Cox PH model can help associate if **mutation A** has higher incidence of events (relapse, death, etc) compared to **no mutation**
  
  - Results: Presence of **mutation A** is associated with a 2x increased risk of death from the time of diagnosis (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5-2.2, p-value=0.05)

---

# Cox Proportional Hazards Regression: libraries

- CPH can be used to relate many risk factors and variables  simultaneously to survival time. 
- Here, I will present a univariate CPH model for simplicity. 

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(censored)
library(survival)
str(aml) #dataframe provided withthe survival package
```

---

# Cox Proportional Hazards Regression 

- Note `Surv(time, status)` is from the survival package and calculate Kaplan-Meier estimates which take into account censoring (right, left, interval) 

```{r}
tidymodels_prefer() # to prevent common clashes

cph_fit <-
  proportional_hazards(engine = "survival") %>% 
  fit(Surv(time, status) ~ x, data = aml)

cph_fit
```

---

# Cox Proportional Hazards Regression 

```{r}
# cox proportional Hazards
cph_fit2 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ x, data = aml)
    
cph_fit2
```

---

# Cox Proportional Hazards Regression

```{r}
summary(cph_fit2) 
```

---

# Cox Proportional Hazards Regression

.center[**Versus**]

```{r}
tidy(cph_fit)
```

---

# Predict with New Data

- First, simulate some patient outcome data 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
new_data <- tibble(Patient=paste0("p",1:10),
                   time=sample(3:200, size=10), 
                   status=sample(c(1,0), size=10, replace = T, prob=c(0.3,0.7)), 
                   x=sample(c("Maintained","Nonmaintained"), size=10, replace=T) %>% 
                     factor(., levels=levels(aml$x)))

head(new_data)
```

---

# Predict with New Data

- Predict the survival probabilities (type = "survival") at given times (times argument)

```{r}
times <- seq(0,72, by=6)

prediction_df <- predict(cph_fit, new_data, type = "survival", time = times) %>% 
  bind_cols(new_data) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(.pred)) %>% 
  group_by(Patient) %>% 
  mutate(n_pred=1:n()) %>% 
  ungroup() 

head(prediction_df)
```

- Note: `unnest()` flattens columns that contain list into regular columns

---

# Predict with New Data

- Visualize the data with `geom_step` to create a Kaplan-Meier curve. 

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
prediction_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = .time, y = .pred_survival, group = x, 
             col = x)) +
  geom_step(lwd = 1.25) + 
  labs(x = "Time (months)", y = "Survival Probability") +
  theme_classic()
```

---

# More Advanced Models 

- regularized cox proportional hazards models 
- compare to [`glmnet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/vignettes/Coxnet.pdf) R package 
  - much more difficult interface in `glmnet`

````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
cph_glmnet_strata_fit <-
  proportional_hazards(penalty = 0.1, mixture = 0.75) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet") %>%
  fit(Surv(age, adopted) ~ . + strata(sex), data = dogs)
```
````

---


# More Advanced Models 

- for example, using decisions trees 
  - boost_tree()
  - decision_tree()
  - rand_forest()

````markdown
```{r}`r ''`
bag_fit <-
  bag_tree() %>% #defines an ensemble of decision trees.
  set_mode("censored regression") %>%
  set_engine("rpart", times = 50) %>%
  fit(Surv(age, adopted) ~ ., data = dogs)
```
````

---

# Upcoming Support in Survival Analysis 

--

- A role for censoring indicator columns and a step `step_surv()` in recipes.
--

- A new ROC metric for survival models in `yardstick`.
--

- An adaption of workflows and `tune` is to follow after that.
